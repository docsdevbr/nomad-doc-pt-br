# `abs` Function

`abs` returns the absolute value of the given number. In other words, if the
number is zero or positive then it is returned as-is, but if it is negative
then it is multiplied by -1 to make it positive before returning it.

## Examples

```shell-session
> abs(23)
23
> abs(0)
0
> abs(-12.4)
12.4
```
