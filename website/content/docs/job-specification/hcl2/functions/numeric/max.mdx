# `max` Function

`max` takes one or more numbers and returns the greatest number from the set.

## Examples

```shell-session
> max(12, 54, 3)
54
```

If the numbers are in a list or set value, use `...` to expand the collection
to individual arguments:

```shell-session
> max([12, 54, 3]...)
54
```
