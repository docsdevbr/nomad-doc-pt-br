# Dynamic Application Sizing Max Strategy Plugin

<EnterpriseAlert>
  This functionality only exists in Nomad Autoscaler Enterprise. This is not
  present in the open source version of Nomad Autoscaler.
</EnterpriseAlert>

The `app-sizing-max` plugin calculates the maximum value seen for the target
resource within the available dataset. This plugin is ideally suited for memory
resources since workloads donâ€™t release their memory too often and
underprovisioning could cause OOM errors.

## Agent Configuration Options

The `app-sizing-max` plugin is automatically launched by Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise and so the following setup is optional.

```hcl
strategy "app-sizing-max" {
  driver = "app-sizing-max"
}
```

## Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "max" {
  strategy "app-sizing-max" {}
}
```

The `app-sizing-max` plugin doesn't have any configuration.
